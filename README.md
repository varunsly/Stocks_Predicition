 the future stock price.
 
 RightNow, This model gives some appropriate trend 
 
 This model is based on the Black-shoe model or Statistical arbitrage
 # Data

 For Now I have train the model on the S&P 500 and TATA stock data. The data is daily stock price. Each day has the following pieces of data:
